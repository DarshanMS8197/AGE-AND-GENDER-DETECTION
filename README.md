This project implements age and gender detection using Python and deep learning frameworks like OpenCV and TensorFlow. It processes facial images or live webcam feeds to predict a personâ€™s age group and gender with high accuracy. The model is trained on publicly available datasets, ensuring reliable performance across diverse demographics. The system uses face detection, preprocessing, and classification pipelines for real-time predictions. This project is ideal for learning computer vision, machine learning, and AI applications. Detailed documentation, sample code, and usage instructions are provided. Contributions and improvements are welcome to enhance accuracy, expand datasets, and integrate additional features.
